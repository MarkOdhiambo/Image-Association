The work was done there where several challenges encountered if you want to work on any data you'll have to import on
the current working directory and work on it, the importation of multiple images at the same time was giving me an error
and due to time constraint working on it took several unsuccesfull hours.
Past that all was okay but the model for the classification was giving me 6 clusters which can be reduced by using a
more powerful machine and running the data as is I had to resize the images. The mean-shift algorithm is rather computationally
heavy.
